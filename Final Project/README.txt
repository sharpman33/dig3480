For my game, I decided to further work on Challenge 2. I’ve made several different changes including new visuals for coins and powerups. I also made some significant changes to gameplay including overhauling the score system and adding powerups. Finally, I adjusted and added some new sound effects when the player interacts with items within the game.

Visual
The mains things that I touched on for visuals is changing the sprites for coins as well as adding animations for them. I also included new sprites and animations for the powerups that I added

Gameplay
The first gameplay change I added is by adding powerup items. I decided to add two different powerup items. Speed Boost Powerup, which will increase the player’s movement speed, and Point Boost Powerup, which will double the score gain for each coin that the player collects. Each powerup lasts 5 seconds and do not stack.
Another gameplay change I added is changing the score system in the game. For each level, the player must collect all coins to proceed to the next level or win. Because I added a point boost powerup, it would deem the powerup useless if the score would reset upon reaching a new level. Instead, I added a high score panel when the player wins. Players will be able to compete and challenge themselves to reach highest score possible

o	Powerup Items (speed boost, point boost)
o	Score System Overhaul (added high scores)

Audio
	For the game audio, I added several new audios for when the player interacts with the world. I added lose game sound, coin collect sound, hit enemy sound, and powerup sound (2 different sound for each powerup)
